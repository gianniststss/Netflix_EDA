## Analysis
The project includes Jupyter notebooks that explore the data and visualize the results. The notebooks cover the following topics:
## Contents
The Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation:** This section includes data cleaning and data wrangling steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** This section includes visualizations and analyses of the data to explore trends and patterns within the dataset.
3. **Conclusion:** This section includes a summary of the insights gained from the analysis.
## Environment
The following Python libraries were used in this analysis:

To run the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, you will need to create a Python environment with the required libraries. We have included an environment.yml file that you can use to create a new environment with the required libraries.

The following libraries are included in the environment:

- pandas==1.3.3
- numpy==1.21.2
- seaborn==0.11.2
